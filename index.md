## SFI-MVLEM-3D: three-dimensional, four-node, macroscopic element for RC walls

### Description

The SFI-MVLEM-3D model is an extension of the two-dimensional, two-node Shear-Flexure-Interaction Multiple-Vertical-Line-Element-Model ([SFI-MVLEM](https://opensees.berkeley.edu/wiki/index.php/SFI_MVLEM_-_Cyclic_Shear-Flexure_Interaction_Model_for_RC_Walls)). The baseline SFI-MVLEM, which is essentially a line element for rectangular walls subjected to in-plane loading, is extended in this study to a three-dimensional model formulation by applying geometric transformation of the element degrees of freedom that convert it into a four-node element formulation, as well as by incorporating linear elastic out-of-plane behavior based on the Kirchhoff plate theory.
